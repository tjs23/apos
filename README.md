# APOS - Accelerated Protein Orthology Search

## Benefits

Allows any protein sequence query; partial, out-of-clade, chimeric
Query anchored for orthology
Phylogenetically anchored
TBLASTN checks for missing annotations
Include close paralogues
On-demand clustering
Eukarya, archea, bacteria clades
Automatic logo plots, seq alignments, phylo trees, in various formats, group spot plots
Fast flask app

## Agglomerative profile/LV generation

Selection of closest; vector DB
Aggregate
Regenerate
Expand

## Setup

Fix IHS first; for baseline comparison
Phylo tree
Species, proteomes, genomes
LVs
